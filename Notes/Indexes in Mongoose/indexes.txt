Indexes are data structures in MongoDB that improve the 
speed of queries by allowing the database to quickly locate
relevant documents without scanning the entire collection.
In Mongoose, you can define indexes on your schemas to
optimize queries for your application.

There are two main types of indexes in Mongoose:
1. Regular indexes: These indexes improve the performance of queries that sort or filter on the indexed field.
2. Unique indexes: These indexes enforce uniqueness on the indexed field. This means that no two documents in the collection can have the same value for the indexed field.

// Unique Property in Mongoose Schema vs Index
* Both the schema unique property and the index unique property create unique indexes, but they have some key differences:
1. Both options enforce uniqueness on the indexed field.
2. Use the schema unique property for a simple and concise way to define unique indexes.
3. Use the index unique property when you need more control over the index configuration.
